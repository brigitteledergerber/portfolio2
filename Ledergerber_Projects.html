              <h4>Principles of Engineering - November 1st to 16th, 2018</h4> <!--text displayed on page-->
              <p>The objective of this project was to build a prototype of a car that demonstrates solar and hydrogen technologies and can test and compare the power sources. My specific role in this project, as the group leader,  was designing ways for the cells to be held in place while the car is moving, write about my team's final design in the documentation, and keeping my team on task. One challenge my team and I overcame was finding an effective and cosmetically pleasing way for the cells to be secured to the car while it is moving. At first my group utilized rubber bands to do so, but the cells were not stable enough and the design looked unproffesional. I was the group leader of this project, which means I was responsible for my team's productivity and completion of the project on time. Working with a team also required the four of us to all be open minded and willing to compromise on design decisions.

              <h4>Principles of Engineering - January 18th to 24th, 2019</h4> <!--text displayed on page-->
              <p>The objective of this project was to build two prototype projectiles that exhibit properties of velocity in order to test and evaluate aerodynamic design decisions. My role in this project was to brainstorm and design two protoype projectiles. First, I was required to create and build one design, then test it. After evaluating my first design through a launch test, I made a second desgin with modifications that would aid my projectile in flying farther. I was also responsible for the analysis and collection of my data and modification process. One challenge my team and I overcame was how to modify our projectiles in order for them to be lighter and have less wind resistance. We decided to omit the exposure of the paper material on the rocket in order to make the shape of the rocket smoother, therefore experiencing less resisitance. While working together, my partner and I were required to be respectful of eachothers decisions and ideas, while remaining on task and focused.

                <h4>Computer Science Principles - November 6th to December 3rd, 2019</h4> <!--text displayed on page-->
                <p>The objective of this project was to create a multi-page website using HTML and Bootstrap to practice web development. The main challenge I faced with this project was formatting the home page so that all of the different cells lined up with each other, leaving no extra white space. The easiest part of this project for me was deciding what to write on my “About Me Page” because I already have a relatively clear idea of my goals. The most interesting part of this project was learning about how different HTML commands interacted with Bootstrap to modify different aspects of the website. This was an individual project, so I created on this website by myself. Working alone was beneficial because it allowed me to control the timeline in which I would complete the project and work on the project more efficiently. However, I found that when working alone, I did not have the benefit of a variety of ideas being contributed and the fun of working in collaboration with others.
