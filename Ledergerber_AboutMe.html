            <p>For the past four years at Dublin High School, my interests have heavily leaned towards software engineering. Therefore, I have decided to parlay this interest into a career in project management in the engineering field. To achieve this goal, I will complete my high school education in the Engineering Academy and attend a business program at a university in California. After receiving my college degree, I will work as a project manager at an engineering company. Being a project manager interests me because I believe they are the people who are behind all of the work that engineers do. They're the reason why engineers have accomplishments because they organize everything and lead everyone to success. <!--text displayed on page-->

            The characteristics I possess related to project management are being a natural leader, organized, and responsible. My ability to naturally and successfully lead others is also necessary for my role as captain of Dublin High's Hip Hop Team. As captain, I am responsible for my team's cooperation, organization, and motivation. Another position I hold that demonstrates my leadership abilities is being the co-founder of an online business. I co-founded <a href="Brigitte_Ledergerber_Resume.pdf"><b>Stupid Co.</b></a>, a handmade/hand-dyed clothing and accessory business that donates 100% of its profits to the NAACP. As Co-Founder, leadership is not the only skill one needs to possess--responsibility is equally important. I always stick to my word and follow a schedule, which is a trait project managers need to have because their jobs are all about keeping others accountable. I am also very organized, which is demonstrated by my ability to balance and keep track of school work and the other events in my life.<!--text displayed on page-->

            My most significant accomplishments from high school are founding <a href="Brigitte_Ledergerber_Resume.pdf"><b>Stupid Co.</b></a> and dancing on my school's hip hop team. My achievements on the Dublin High Hip Hop Team have been my captainship, making the varsity team, and the awards my team and I have received. I was a junior varsity team captain in my sophomore year. Along with this personal achievement, my team and I have won both the JAMZ State and National First Place titles three years in a row and the JAMZ Best Choreography Award twice. After two years on my hip hop team as a junior varsity dancer, I made it onto the varsity team. From being on this team, I have learned about the practice of teamwork and leadership. My captainship has taught me how to be an effective leader while maintaining communication and cooperation among the team. Mainly, this experience has taught me how to be a leader and not a boss. <!--text displayed on page-->

            In conclusion, every experience I have had through high school has immersed me in the engineering field and has helped me towards my career goal of becoming a project manager. Thank you for taking the time to read about me. Feel free to read more about my projects and work experience on this site.</p> <!--text displayed on page-->
