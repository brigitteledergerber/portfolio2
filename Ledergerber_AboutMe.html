            <p>Ever since the eighth grade, my interests have heavily leaned towards engineering, whether it be software engineering or mechanical. Therefore, I have decided to parlay this interest into a career in project management in the engineering field. In order to achieve this goal, my plan is to complete my high school education in the Engineering Academy and complete engineering  activities outside of school.  After high school, my plan is to attend a Business program at a university, preferably at  UC Santa Barbara or UC San Diego.  After college, I will work as a Project Manager in the engineering field. Being a Project Manager interests me because I believe they are the people who are behind all of the work that engineers do. They're the reason why engineers have accomplishments because they organize everything, leading to success. <!--text displayed on page-->

            The characteristics I possess that relate to project management are being a natural leader, organized, and responsible. My ability to naturally and successfully lead others is utilized not only on my Hip Hop Team in which I was chosen to be a captain of,  but project management as well. Project Managers are constantly  managing teams and they are the person who must lead all the team members. In situations where one must rise up to lead others, I am usually the one to fill this position. Another leadership position I hold is the Vice Presidency of the One Globe Club at my high school, which is geared towards volunteering and charity. I am in this leadership role, not only because I have leadership qualities, but because I am very responsible. I am one to always stick to my word and follow a schedule, which is a trait Project Managers need to have because their jobs are all about keeping others accountable. I am also very organized, which is shown in my ability to balance and keep track of school work and the other events in my life. <!--text displayed on page-->

            Some of my major accomplishments in high school so far are my captainship on my hip hop team, my achievement of being on the varsity team, and the awards my team and I have recieved. I was chosen as a junior varsity team captain last year on my team, and along with this personal achievement, my team and I have won both the JAMZ State and National First Place titles, along with the JAMZ Best Choreography Award twice. After two years on my hip hop team as a junior varsity dancer, I made it onto the varsity team. From being on this team, I have learned alot about the practice of teamwork and leadership. Being captain has taught me how to be an effective leader, while still being able to communicate and cooperate with my team. Mainly, this experience has taught me how to be a leader, and not a boss. <!--text displayed on page-->

            In conclusion, every experience I have had through middle and high school has helped me towards my career goals of becoming a Project Manager. Thank you for taking the time to read about me and feel free to read more about my projects and work experience on this site.</p> <!--text displayed on page-->
