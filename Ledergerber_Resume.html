            <p>One of the many ways the Engineering Academy prepares me for my future in project management in the technological field is through the opportunity of field trips. One field trip I've atteneded that gave me useful knowledge and was memorable was touring Stanford University and visting the Computer History Museum. I learned so much useful information from this trip about not only Stanford University, a highly-ranked school, but also useful information about Computer Science, which is necessary for the field I desire to work in. I learned about many things regarding Computer Science and Engineering, such as about autonomous vehicles and early machines. <!--Field Trip-->

            Another experience the Engineering Academy has provided is the opportunity to listen to Guest Speakers who work in the Engineering Field. A memorable presentation I listened to was by Dan Cherrier and Natalina Bernardi, who spoke about "Proffesional Engineering Liscensing with Emphasis on Civil Engineering." These speakers taught the class about what they do at their jobs as proffesional engineers, what path to take in education to become a Civil Engineer, and the five main fields of Civil Engineering, which are construction, geotechinical, structural, transportation, and water resources/environmental. While I do not plan on being a Civil Engineer in the future, I had never previously heard much about Civil Engineering past it's name, so it was very interesting and beneficial to me to hear about what Civil Engineers do and how Civil Engineering is applied in our world. <!--Guest Speaker--> </p>
