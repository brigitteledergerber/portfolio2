            <p>One of the many ways the Engineering Academy prepares me for my future in project management in the technological field is through the opportunity of field trips. One field trip I've atteneded that gave me useful knowledge and was memorable was touring Stanford University and visting the Computer History Museum. I learned so much useful information from this trip about not only Stanford University, a highly-ranked school, but also useful information about Computer Science, which is necessary for the field I desire to work in. I learned about many things regarding Computer Science and Engineering, such as about autonomous vehicles and early machines. 
            <br></br>
            Another field trip I embarked on with the Engineering Academy that had a lasting impact on me was the S.H.E. Leads Conference centered around successful women in S.T.E.M. fields. This conference included influential speakers that discussed their career backgrounds and workshops that taught the female student attendees about different fields in the Silicon Valley. One workshop I participated in was centered around civil engineering, and the challenge given was to create a working model of a water drainage system for a client's driveway. Utilizing teamwork and problem-solving skills, my team and I were able to successfully create the model, and even won a prize for being the first group to finish. These experiences I had at this conference and the stories I learned from various women in the job force helped me gain a better understanding of what the future holds for me in my career and what options I have to obtain a successful S.T.E.M. job.

            Additionally, the Engineering Academy has provided is the opportunity to listen to Guest Speakers who work in the Engineering Field. A memorable presentation I listened to was by Dan Cherrier and Natalina Bernardi, who spoke about "Proffesional Engineering Liscensing with Emphasis on Civil Engineering." These speakers taught the class about what they do at their jobs as proffesional engineers, what path to take in education to become a Civil Engineer, and the five main fields of Civil Engineering, which are construction, geotechinical, structural, transportation, and water resources/environmental. While I do not plan on being a Civil Engineer in the future, I had never previously heard much about Civil Engineering past it's name, so it was very interesting and beneficial to me to hear about what Civil Engineers do and how Civil Engineering is applied in our world. 
            <br></br>
            More recently, I listened with my fellow engineering students to a guest speaker by the name of Emma Cheng. She works at Bio-Rad in the Human Resources field. This speech gave me a more in-depth look at the hiring process and business side of a company. Emma Cheng taught us about what to expect when attending and interview, and the different things interviewers will you judge you based on. For example, a question from a student that she answered was "What is expected of a candidate at an on-site interview?". She responded that interviewers at an on-site interview will typically ask questions around someone's experience and what they learned about their desired position in school. Overall, this guest speaker's presentation was very helpful to me because it made me feel much more prepared for entering the job-force, whether it be for a high school summer job, an internship, or a very important interview for a job after college.<!--Guest Speaker--> </p>
